                    <h3>Lecture</h3> 
                    We began discussing Assignment 2.1 and to be honest it looks very intimidating, the example given looks amazing! I don’t know if my website will be as good but I will try my best. Kind of confused about how many pages we should design? I think I’m going to stick to the idea of two user journeys, which will probably end up being quite a few pages. <br> We then discussed colours in websites, for my website I am aiming to have quite a calming blue colour palette, as my website is aimed towards a user persona with excessive worries in their life. Discussing accessibility was also helpful as my user persona has dyslexia, so I will need to focus on dyslexia-friendly fonts and high contrast between text and background. 

                    <h3>Assignment</h3> 
                    I was still very busy with other classes this week but did have some fun designing a colour palette for my website. I challenged myself to keep it simple (I have a habit of making colour palettes with about 10 different colours) and ended up choosing just classic black and white, some calming muted blue and purple shades (for reasons discussed above), and a more saturated blue for a pop of colour.

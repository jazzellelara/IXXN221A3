                    <h3>Lecture</h3> 
                    We began by discussing composition, starting with grids. I learned the importance of using hierarchy in grids to keep website content well organised and applied this concept to my “home page” wireframe. We also discussed visual hierarchy,  with a focus on text composition and guiding the eye of users so that they do not feel lost on the page. I applied these techniques in my “profile page” and “selected media page” wireframes. Colour is also an important part of creating visual hierarchy, with brighter colours grabbing the attention of the users. <br>We also discussed mental models and the importance of keeping the layout of our websites consistent with other websites in order to make them easier for the user to navigate. We then discussed affordances, ways to clearly direct users around our websites (e.g. using bright colours for buttons, underlining links). 

                    <h3>Assignment</h3> 
                    Started producing my wireframes right before the start of this week, as I was busy during the mid-trimester study break. I ended up finishing them after this week’s lecture, which was good in a way as I got to apply some of the content discussed in the lecture to my wireframes. <br>I ended up choosing to depict two journeys, the first journey being the landing page → sign up page → profile page → home page → selected media page, and the second journey being shorter with friends page → friend’s profile page → messaging page. This is a lot of pages and I am beginning to wonder if I am making too much work for myself. <br>
                    <br> A couple of days later I created iterations for the first journey of my website. This involved choosing a website name (Amiva), selecting suitable fonts and using the knowledge I had from the lectures to apply effective design practices, making sure the website looked good on both desktop and mobile. I learned a very valuable lesson: website design takes a lot longer than it looks.

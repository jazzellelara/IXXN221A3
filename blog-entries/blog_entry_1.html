                    <h3>Lecture</h3> 
                    Got an idea of who is in class and learnt about the expectations and assignments of this course. The teaching staff all seem very lovely! We all made name tags with some info about ourselves (see mine above). I used FigJam for the first time, which was cool. The course seems very well laid out and seems to lay down some really good crucial web design knowledge. I was also happy to see that my friends were in the same class when everyone was doing introductions. Overall a good start to the course and I am excited to see what this course has to offer.

                    <h3>Assignment</h3> 
                    I was still working on my CMS website at the start of Week 11 (mainly working on responsiveness to different screen sizes). After a lot of tears, I finally got it (mostly) working, and from then on I just linked all the pages together and put together the progress screenshots I took in my design process document with some annotations. I handed in the project very early on the morning it was due. <br>
                    <br>Although it was a bit of a painful process, I now know the basics of using CMS so that's cool! I think that while WebFlow was more difficult to use and also had a paywall, if I had to do CMS again I would use it, as it had more detailed features that allowed for a level of refinement EditorX couldn’t provide.

                    <h3>Lecture</h3> 
                    We started the week by continuing to discuss the history of the Internet. I’m finding it really interesting, I thought Wikipedia would have been founded earlier than that! The million-dollar homepage was pretty funny, I’d never heard about it before. Skeuomorphism was so nostalgic, it reminded me of using my first-generation iPod Touch when I was around 6. Discussed how to effectively set goals for ourselves as designers. 

                    <h3>Workshop and Assignment</h3> 
                    We did an exercise on making Venn diagrams. Much like last week’s exercise we worked in a group and received feedback from the tutors. I started Assignment One after this and made the persona and Venn diagram in Adobe Illustrator, applying the feedback I got in the workshops. I decided that I wanted to create a social media platform that focuses on making connections with people based on shared interests. This platform would give users media/interest recommendations and help connect them to potential new friends. 

                    <h3>Coding Lecture</h3> 
                    Also had the first coding lecture going over lists and image links. I  have coding experience so I was already familiar with the lecture content, but it was demonstrated well and helped refresh my memory.

                    <h3>Lecture</h3> 
                    We discussed responsive design, specifically how to scale websites using grids, breakpoints, flexboxes, et cetera. A great point was that we also need to take into consideration how users are navigating a website, whether it be a mouse/keyboard, touchscreen, or something else. Responsive design is a must for our Assignment 2.2 websites. We also learned the importance of file organisation and alt text. 

                    <h3>Assignment</h3> 
                    I decided that I wanted to make my website using CMS instead of coding, and the design I made was quite complex. Other than that I focused on other classes for this week.

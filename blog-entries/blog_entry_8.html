                    <h3>Assignment</h3> 
                    I started the week by designing the iteration of my second journey for my website Amiva. It was just as fiddly as the first one but was slightly easier/faster to produce as I already had a design style established. Speaking of style I finished off my style guide, containing my fonts, components, icons and more. <br>After designing all of the iterations, I worked on my high-fidelity prototype. I linked together all my pages and improved a few final things. I then wrote my design rationale, where I discussed in depth every design decision that went into making my website prototype. I tried to be as detailed as possible and I am confident that I covered everything that needed discussing. <br>I was then able to hand in my completed project, which was a huge relief. Honestly, this project was really difficult for me, but I learnt lots of really helpful skills that will definitely aid me in future, and for that I am thankful. 

                    <h3>Lecture</h3> 
                    The lecture was just presentations, so there wasn't much to report. Everyone else’s website looked super good! Lots of carousels.

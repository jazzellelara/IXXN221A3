                    <h3>Lecture</h3> 
                    In this lecture we just recapped Assignment 3 which was helpful as last time we went over it I was really stressed about making my CMS website and didn’t take a lot of it in. I am coding my blog! Hopefully, it goes well. Also discovered that I need to go back and add some more reflective thinking to my previous blog posts. 

                    <h3>Assignment</h3> 
                    This week I began working on coding my blog. I started by coding the base for the blog website. I chose to use flexboxes to structure my webpage, as they are very responsive but also because I am the most familiar with them. I put borders around all of the different sections so I could sort out bugs as they came up, which they very much did.<br> The one that took me the longest to work out was the navigation options in the nav bar. Initially, I had them as a list, but that wasn’t working, so I made them not a list and fiddled with the positioning and that worked. I have so far made the landing page and one blog entry page. I just chose to use my logo from my other website as a placeholder logo for now. <br>
                    <br>I then began going back over my blog entries from this trimester and got very annoyed at my past self (why did I only write a single sentence some weeks?). I added some more details to the ones that needed it and gathered images for each week. Eventually, I got to Week 12, which is what I am typing now (blog-ception). I still have a lot more work to do on my blog website, but I will have to do that next week. 

                    <h3>Conclusion</h3> 
                    This class taught me some really useful skills, and I’m not just saying that. I liked how classes were still collaborative even though they were online, and even though it was stressful at the time I like that we were forced to step outside our comfort zones to learn new techniques. <br>Overall, if I choose to make a website in future, I feel like I have all of the knowledge and resources I would need to do that, and for that I have this class to thank.

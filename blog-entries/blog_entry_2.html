                    <h3>Lecture</h3> 
                    In this week’s lecture, we went over the assignments for the year. I like that we have the option to pick what assignments we would like to do. At the moment I think I’m leaning towards coding my blog, not my website. Learned about the history of the internet. I was especially interested in Geocities, a place where people could build their own websites. They're super retro-looking, it’s really cool that we can still view them so many years later. 
                    <h3>Workshop</h3> 
                    We created a persona in Figma (image), and the feedback we got was to think about how we can address the user’s pain points using UX design. This feedback was helpful as it encouraged me to consider how people with dyslexia, poor vision, et cetera would interact with my website, and how to accommodate things like this. I have not yet started assignment one but this activity set me up with a really clear idea of the important points to include when making a persona.

                    <h3>Lecture</h3> 
                    The lecture began (after website of the week) with the final part of the history of websites. Again the “like” button was something I thought was created earlier, considering it is such a crucial part of any social media nowadays. Realised I should maybe look into making a dribbble account. 2009 marked the introduction of Flexbox! I’m a big fan of Flexboxes. However, not a big fan of the Corporate Memphis art style, I think it’s ugly. <br> We moved on to discussing customer journey maps and user flows. It was helpful learning about the anatomy of a user flow diagram, and what shapes to use where. The Assignment One recap wrapped it all up nicely. 

                    <h3>Assignment</h3> 
                    The next day I created the user flow and customer journey map for my assignment. I have found screenshotting parts of the lecture and putting them into my Illustrator doc to be very helpful. When making the user flow I realised that the website I have created is actually quite complex. I am a bit scared of designing and making it. <br> Later in the week I put all my diagrams into my document and began typing the explanation, however, very annoyingly I got a cold and had to take a few days off.
